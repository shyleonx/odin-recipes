    <h4>Ingridients</h4>

        <li>2 Potatoes, chopped </li>
        <li>2 Carrots, chopped </li>
        <li>2 Tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Curry Powder (Gregg’s)</li>
        <li>Garam Masala (Gregg’s)</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Rice (about 3 cups) - please remember to prepare the rice separately as it’s not included in the method below</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>    
        <li>In a frying pan on medium-high heat, cook the chopped meat with some butter until lightly seared then put aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan cook the potatoes and carrots with some butter until slightly golden on the outside then also put aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot on medium heat, cook the garlic and ginger in about a tablespoon of oil until fragrant, then add the onions and celery to the pot.</li>
        <li>Once the onions and celery are soft, add about ½ tablespoon of honey and cook until slightly golden in colour. </li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to low. Add 2 tablespoons of oil, 3 tablespoons of curry powder, 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, and ½ tablespoon of garam masala. Stir and cook for about 5 min. It should turn into a thick paste.</li>
        <li>To the curry paste you just made, add the diced tomatoes, stir and cook for another 2-3 mins.
        </li>
        <li>Add the stock to the pot slowly and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the pre-cooked meat and vegetables, generous amount of salt, and 2 bay leaves to the pot. The stock should be just covering all the goodies (if not add boiling water). Simmer on low heat for 30-40mins. Make sure to check on it and stir every now and then so the curry doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot as it thickens. </li>
        <li>Once the vegetables and meat are tender cooked through, add salt to taste and take off the heat. You can also add more garam masala or chilli to taste if you like.</li>
        <li>Pour the curry over a plate of rice and voilà! You’ve just made a tasty Japanese curry from scratch!</li>
    </ol>
